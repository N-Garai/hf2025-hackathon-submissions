## Project Title
ReliefBridge


## Project Description    
ReliefBridge is a real-time disaster relief coordination platform that bridges the gap between victims in need and volunteers ready to help during emergencies and natural disasters.
Victims can request their help and volunteer can claim the task in real-time, allin a structured ,georefernced way.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
ReliefBridge was inspired by the recurring challenge of delayed aid during natural disasters. Too often, survivors struggle because resources exist but aren’t efficiently connected to those in need.
Even traditional communication methods fail, and there's no centralized system to track and prioritize emergency requests.
Our project bridges this gap by creating a streamlined platform that links donors, NGOs, and affected communities in real time—ensuring help reaches the right place at the right moment.
